Security:

Ensuring just the right agents have access to just the right resources at just the right time

- Has properties that must exist even in the presence of strategic adversaries

    o Correctness : get a correct output for an input

    o Safety :

    o Robustness

- Security mindset: how things can be made to fail

- CIA triangle:

    o Confidentiality : keep data secret

    o Integrity : data should not be altered improperly

    o Availability : system/resources should be available and used as anticipated by intended users

- Other Properties:

    o Privacy : controlling the amount of information revealed by the data

    o Authenticity : Proving that a particular piece of data belongs to an individual

    o Anonymity : Not wanting people to know who you are or the site to know who you are

    o Plausible Deniability : System evidencing that a claim can be denied

    o Non Repudiation : System shows that the claim can't be denied

    o Forward Secrecy : A confidential channel is between A and B using an encryption. If an adversary breaches the encryption, the adversary will be able to see the system and break the confidentiality of the channel now onwards but can't see any past messages

- Two philosophies about security:

    o Binary: Something is secure or not secure

    § An attacker has limitations X and there is a policy Y, Y can't be violated unless if X has been broken

    § Pros:

    o Risk Management : Grey scale of security and not secure

    § Mostly based on cost

- Security is defined by specific security policies

Policy addresses:

- Threat, vulnerabilities, likelihood, impact and protection

Threat modelling:

-  Analyse the adversary by their capability and motivation

- You have a resourceful strategic adversary (what can they corrupt, influence, observe, modify or control)

- Examples of threats:

    - Spoofing (pretending to be someone else)

    - Tampering (Man in the middle)

    - Repudiation (pretend to be someone else whilst they claim it's not them)

    - Info disclosure

    - Denial of Service

    - Elevation of privilege
