## 2402. Meeting Rooms III
    You are given an integer n. There are n rooms numbered from 0 to n - 1.

    You are given a 2D integer array meetings where meetings[i] = [starti, endi] means that a meeting will be held during the half-closed time interval [starti, endi). All the values of starti are unique.

    Meetings are allocated to rooms in the following manner:

    Each meeting will take place in the unused room with the lowest number.
    If there are no available rooms, the meeting will be delayed until a room becomes free. The delayed meeting should have the same duration as the original meeting.
    When a room becomes unused, meetings that have an earlier original start time should be given the room.
    Return the number of the room that held the most meetings. If there are multiple rooms, return the room with the lowest number.

    A half-closed interval [a, b) is the interval between a and b including a and not including b.

    

    Example 1:

    Input: n = 2, meetings = [[0,10],[1,5],[2,7],[3,4]]
    Output: 0
    Explanation:
    - At time 0, both rooms are not being used. The first meeting starts in room 0.
    - At time 1, only room 1 is not being used. The second meeting starts in room 1.
    - At time 2, both rooms are being used. The third meeting is delayed.
    - At time 3, both rooms are being used. The fourth meeting is delayed.
    - At time 5, the meeting in room 1 finishes. The third meeting starts in room 1 for the time period [5,10).
    - At time 10, the meetings in both rooms finish. The fourth meeting starts in room 0 for the time period [10,11).
    Both rooms 0 and 1 held 2 meetings, so we return 0. 
    Example 2:

    Input: n = 3, meetings = [[1,20],[2,10],[3,5],[4,9],[6,8]]
    Output: 1
    Explanation:
    - At time 1, all three rooms are not being used. The first meeting starts in room 0.
    - At time 2, rooms 1 and 2 are not being used. The second meeting starts in room 1.
    - At time 3, only room 2 is not being used. The third meeting starts in room 2.
    - At time 4, all three rooms are being used. The fourth meeting is delayed.
    - At time 5, the meeting in room 2 finishes. The fourth meeting starts in room 2 for the time period [5,10).
    - At time 6, all three rooms are being used. The fifth meeting is delayed.
    - At time 10, the meetings in rooms 1 and 2 finish. The fifth meeting starts in room 1 for the time period [10,12).
    Room 0 held 1 meeting while rooms 1 and 2 each held 2 meetings, so we return 1. 
    

    Constraints:

    1 <= n <= 100
    1 <= meetings.length <= 105
    meetings[i].length == 2
    0 <= starti < endi <= 5 * 105
    All the values of start are unique.

Design a logger system that receives a stream of messages along with their timestamps. Each unique message should only be printed at most every 10 seconds (i.e. a message printed at timestamp t will prevent other identical messages from being printed until timestamp t + 10).

All messages will come in chronological order. Several messages may arrive at the same timestamp.

Implement the Logger class:

Logger() Initializes the logger object.
bool shouldPrintMessage(int timestamp, string message) Returns true if the message should be printed in the given timestamp, otherwise returns false.
 

Example 1:

Input
["Logger", "shouldPrintMessage", "shouldPrintMessage", "shouldPrintMessage", "shouldPrintMessage", "shouldPrintMessage", "shouldPrintMessage"]
[[], [1, "foo"], [2, "bar"], [3, "foo"], [8, "bar"], [10, "foo"], [11, "foo"]]
Output
[null, true, true, false, false, false, true]

Explanation
Logger logger = new Logger();
logger.shouldPrintMessage(1, "foo");  // return true, next allowed timestamp for "foo" is 1 + 10 = 11
logger.shouldPrintMessage(2, "bar");  // return true, next allowed timestamp for "bar" is 2 + 10 = 12
logger.shouldPrintMessage(3, "foo");  // 3 < 11, return false
logger.shouldPrintMessage(8, "bar");  // 8 < 12, return false
logger.shouldPrintMessage(10, "foo"); // 10 < 11, return false
logger.shouldPrintMessage(11, "foo"); // 11 >= 11, return true, next allowed timestamp for "foo" is 11 + 10 = 21
 

Constraints:

0 <= timestamp <= 109
Every timestamp will be passed in non-decreasing order (chronological order).
1 <= message.length <= 30
At most 104 calls will be made to shouldPrintMessage.

You are given an integer n, which indicates that there are n courses labeled from 1 to n. You are also given an array relations where relations[i] = [prevCoursei, nextCoursei], representing a prerequisite relationship between course prevCoursei and course nextCoursei: course prevCoursei has to be taken before course nextCoursei.

In one semester, you can take any number of courses as long as you have taken all the prerequisites in the previous semester for the courses you are taking.

Return the minimum number of semesters needed to take all courses. If there is no way to take all the courses, return -1.

 

Example 1:


Input: n = 3, relations = [[1,3],[2,3]]
Output: 2
Explanation: The figure above represents the given graph.
In the first semester, you can take courses 1 and 2.
In the second semester, you can take course 3.
Example 2:


Input: n = 3, relations = [[1,2],[2,3],[3,1]]
Output: -1
Explanation: No course can be studied because they are prerequisites of each other.
 

Constraints:

1 <= n <= 5000
1 <= relations.length <= 5000
relations[i].length == 2
1 <= prevCoursei, nextCoursei <= n
prevCoursei != nextCoursei
All the pairs [prevCoursei, nextCoursei] are unique.



## 1110. Given the root of a binary tree, each node in the tree has a distinct value.

After deleting all nodes with a value in to_delete, we are left with a forest (a disjoint union of trees).

Return the roots of the trees in the remaining forest. You may return the result in any order.

 

Example 1:


Input: root = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7], to_delete = [3,5]
Output: [[1,2,null,4],[6],[7]]
Example 2:

Input: root = [1,2,4,null,3], to_delete = [3]
Output: [[1,2,4]]
 

Constraints:

The number of nodes in the given tree is at most 1000.
Each node has a distinct value between 1 and 1000.
to_delete.length <= 1000
to_delete contains distinct values between 1 and 1000.

## 2458. Height of Binary Tree After Subtree Removal Queries

You are given the root of a binary tree with n nodes. Each node is assigned a unique value from 1 to n. You are also given an array queries of size m.

You have to perform m independent queries on the tree where in the ith query you do the following:

Remove the subtree rooted at the node with the value queries[i] from the tree. It is guaranteed that queries[i] will not be equal to the value of the root.
Return an array answer of size m where answer[i] is the height of the tree after performing the ith query.

Note:

The queries are independent, so the tree returns to its initial state after each query.
The height of a tree is the number of edges in the longest simple path from the root to some node in the tree.
 

Example 1:


Input: root = [1,3,4,2,null,6,5,null,null,null,null,null,7], queries = [4]
Output: [2]
Explanation: The diagram above shows the tree after removing the subtree rooted at node with value 4.
The height of the tree is 2 (The path 1 -> 3 -> 2).
Example 2:


Input: root = [5,8,9,2,1,3,7,4,6], queries = [3,2,4,8]
Output: [3,2,3,2]
Explanation: We have the following queries:
- Removing the subtree rooted at node with value 3. The height of the tree becomes 3 (The path 5 -> 8 -> 2 -> 4).
- Removing the subtree rooted at node with value 2. The height of the tree becomes 2 (The path 5 -> 8 -> 1).
- Removing the subtree rooted at node with value 4. The height of the tree becomes 3 (The path 5 -> 8 -> 2 -> 6).
- Removing the subtree rooted at node with value 8. The height of the tree becomes 2 (The path 5 -> 9 -> 3).
 

Constraints:

The number of nodes in the tree is n.
2 <= n <= 105
1 <= Node.val <= n
All the values in the tree are unique.
m == queries.length
1 <= m <= min(n, 104)
1 <= queries[i] <= n
queries[i] != root.val

## 2101. Detonate the Maximum Bombs

You are given a list of bombs. The range of a bomb is defined as the area where its effect can be felt. This area is in the shape of a circle with the center as the location of the bomb.

The bombs are represented by a 0-indexed 2D integer array bombs where bombs[i] = [xi, yi, ri]. xi and yi denote the X-coordinate and Y-coordinate of the location of the ith bomb, whereas ri denotes the radius of its range.

You may choose to detonate a single bomb. When a bomb is detonated, it will detonate all bombs that lie in its range. These bombs will further detonate the bombs that lie in their ranges.

Given the list of bombs, return the maximum number of bombs that can be detonated if you are allowed to detonate only one bomb.

 

Example 1:


Input: bombs = [[2,1,3],[6,1,4]]
Output: 2
Explanation:
The above figure shows the positions and ranges of the 2 bombs.
If we detonate the left bomb, the right bomb will not be affected.
But if we detonate the right bomb, both bombs will be detonated.
So the maximum bombs that can be detonated is max(1, 2) = 2.
Example 2:


Input: bombs = [[1,1,5],[10,10,5]]
Output: 1
Explanation:
Detonating either bomb will not detonate the other bomb, so the maximum number of bombs that can be detonated is 1.
Example 3:


Input: bombs = [[1,2,3],[2,3,1],[3,4,2],[4,5,3],[5,6,4]]
Output: 5
Explanation:
The best bomb to detonate is bomb 0 because:
- Bomb 0 detonates bombs 1 and 2. The red circle denotes the range of bomb 0.
- Bomb 2 detonates bomb 3. The blue circle denotes the range of bomb 2.
- Bomb 3 detonates bomb 4. The green circle denotes the range of bomb 3.
Thus all 5 bombs are detonated.
 

Constraints:

1 <= bombs.length <= 100
bombs[i].length == 3
1 <= xi, yi, ri <= 105
