# Key topics

In a nutshell
• Propositional and first-order logic, syntax, semantics. (need to know last years stuff)
• Axiomatic systems. : two line proofs, axiom given to you
• Tableau — sound and complete for propositional logic, and for FOL : be good at drawing tableaus, guaranteed marks if you do it
• Compactness (cant define connectednesss in a graph, finite structures)
• Recursive sets, recursively enumerable sets. (completeness proofs, need to know what they mean for sure, very imp)
• Validities of FOL — recursively enumerable but not recursive.  (for prop are recursive)
• Validities of arithmetic, not even recursively enumerable. (decidability)
• Modal logic, Kripke frames, Kripke models. ()
• Multimodal Logic, Temporal Logic Tableau for Kripke frames. 
PDL.
Boolean Algebra, Stone's Theorem (definition of boolean algebra and proving a theorem a the , sets)
Binary Relations, identity, converse, composition Relation Algebra, Representable Relation Algebra
• In a nutshell.

know a definition of a proper relation algebra, dont memorise relation algebra, understand that the relation algebra is representable (isomorphic)

k^2 transitive kripke frames : very important
multimodal logic: different modalities and primitive programs (simple questions with diagrams)

past papers (last year and the year before - same syllabus for the last two years, they have klene algebra which we dont need)
previous years papers are also fine but have no material on algebra, instead databases (we dont do databases anymore)
