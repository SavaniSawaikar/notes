# Systems Week 2

## HCI Reading 

Good example of design:
* Durrell Bishop's Marble Answering Machine: makes use of everyday items and our interactions with it to listen to recorded messages, which makes it easier to use and understand and is efficient 
    ```diff
    - But can't be used in a hotel setting because can't authenticate who the user is and the marbles could be nicked
    ```
* Tivo tv remote

When designing items, the user has to be considered at all times, how are they going to be using the item, who and where:
• Considering what people are good and bad at
• Considering what might help people with the way they currently do things
• Thinking through what might provide quality user experiences
• Listening to what people want and getting them involved in the design
• Using user-centered techniques during the design process
