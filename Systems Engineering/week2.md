## HCI Reading 

Good example of design:
* Durrell Bishop's Marble Answering Machine: makes use of everyday items and our interactions with it to listen to recorded messages, which makes it easier to use and understand and is efficient 
    ```diff
    - But can't be used in a hotel setting because can't authenticate who the user is and the marbles could be nicked
    ```
* Tivo tv remote
* Apple ipod

When designing items, the user has to be considered at all times, how are they going to be using the item, who and where:
* Considering what people are good and bad at
* Considering what might help people with the way they currently do things
* Thinking through what might provide quality user experiences
* Listening to what people want and getting them involved in the design
* Using user-centered techniques during the design process

Interaction design can be categorised based on how it is approached and what the scope is.
You want diverse team for a wider range of ideas and fresh perspectives but may have some teamwork issues maybe

Quality of user experience is important, build something that's enjoyable, exciting and pleasurable to use

**Chat GPT summary of the 'technology as an experience framework':**
* User-Centered Focus: Prioritize the user's needs, emotions, and perspectives. Consider how they interact with the technology and how it fits into their daily lives.

* Holistic Experience: Understand that the user's interaction with technology goes beyond mere functionality. It encompasses the entire journey, from initial discovery to eventual obsolescence.

* Emotional Engagement: Recognize the emotional responses technology can elicit, whether it's joy, frustration, satisfaction, or others. Design for positive emotional experiences.

* Integrated Ecosystems: Understand that most technologies don't exist in a vacuum. They are part of larger ecosystems, whether it's software integrating with hardware or apps interacting with other apps. The experience should be seamless across the ecosystem.

* Feedback Loops: Implement mechanisms for users to provide feedback. This helps in refining and enhancing the experience over time.

* Adaptive & Personalized: With advancements in AI and machine learning, technologies can now adapt and personalize user experiences based on preferences and behaviors.

* Accessibility & Inclusivity: Ensure that technology is accessible to all, including those with disabilities. An inclusive design ensures a wider reach and a better overall experience.

* Ethical Considerations: As technology becomes more integrated into our lives, it's crucial to consider the ethical implications, such as privacy, security, and the potential for misuse.

* Iterative Design: The design process should be iterative, involving testing, feedback, and refinement to ensure the technology evolves with the user's needs.

* Future-Proofing: Design with the future in mind. This includes ensuring that technologies can adapt to future trends and changes, and that they remain relevant and usable.
