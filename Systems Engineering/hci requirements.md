# HCI requirements and criteria to meet

* Evidence of consultation with users at each stage (when appropriate)
* Personas
* Sketches
* Evidence of consideration of alternatives
* Evidence of iteration
* Demonstration of a user interacting with the prototype
* Evaluation of prototype
* Citations and relation to the literature

## Aim:
Excellent justification of the choice of methods used for each stage and clear
consideration of alternatives. Excellent demonstration of the use of iteration in
which previous stages are revisited following the outcomes at a given stage. Very
strong evidence that users (or pseudo users) have been consulted wherever
possible or necessary. Effective use of personas or scenarios. Excellent attempt at
relating the development to the literature on HCI and Interaction Design. Report
very clearly shows how a user would interact with the prototype.

## Report on HCI Process
The report should use images and limited text to outline the development of your prototype including the
methods used for establishing user needs, sketches, the methods used for evaluation and the outcome of the
evaluation. It should summarize data collected at all stages in the life cycle. It should include pictures of users
interacting with the prototype. The report should be produced in Microsoft PowerPoint and should be a
maximum of 10 slides including references. It will not be necessary to present or narrate the PowerPoint – you
just need to submit the report as a file. You should not use videos, transitions or animations in your presentation.
Your report should include academic citations and a list of references to relate your work to the academic
literature.

General comments
An excellent report with all the key requirements. Lacking in evidence and too text heavy.

Evidence of consultation with users at each stage (when appropriate) 
Evidence could be improved. Information such as age range, gender,  snapshot of anonymised consent form would be more convincing for surveys, interviews or focus groups

Personas 
Excellent Personas. A photograph of a real person rather than a silhouette would help realism. It would improve if the personas went beyond the person’s job and tried to capture their outlook more generally.

Sketches 
Excellent use of sketches clearly related to the stage of choosing alternatives 

Evidence of consideration of alternatives 
See previous criterion

Evidence of iteration 
Clear iteration after final evaluation. It would have been nice to have seen iteration at an earlier stage

Demonstration of a user interacting with the prototype 
There could be more evidence of this such as photographs or interaction sequence

Evaluation of prototype 
Evidence of Heuristic Evaluation with justification

Citations and relation to the literature 
Strong reference list but none of the references appear to have been cited
